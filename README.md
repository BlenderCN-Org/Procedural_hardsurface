# Procedural_hardsurface
Blender scripts related to procedural details generation for "hard surface" geometry.

The scripts are in a really primitive state for now, you will have to run them manually:
- Open the scripting layout of Blender
- In the text editor window: "Text"->"Open", then select the script corresponding to your Blender version
- Finally, click "Run Script" -> new meshes will be added in the 3D view
